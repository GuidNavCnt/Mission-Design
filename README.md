# Space-Mission-Design
This Project includes MATLAB code for various space mission design problems and their solutions
All of these files were the code I have written to solve various problems during the space mission design and navigation at the Johns Hopkins University applied physics lab
These code files all along with ones in other repos were used to build and design a mission design params with navigation filters to estimate spacecraft position and velocity.
